QUESTION 1: Based on the list of software requirements, identify the system actors (the 'who' in user stories).

Based on the software requirements, the system actors can be identified as follows:        

1. Users: These are the individuals who will use the system to create and assign tasks, view task lists, re-assign and route tasks, and document verbal or telephone communication into patient records.
2. Administrators: These are the individuals responsible for managing the system, including installing, starting up, and possibly connecting it.
3. Prescribers: These are medical professionals who will use the system to provide electronic communication with pharmacies or other intended recipients of medication orders.        
4. Pharmacists: These are medical professionals who will receive electronic medication orders through the system.
5. Clinical Personnel: These are medical professionals who currently use or access the system.

Note that these actors may have different roles and responsibilities, but they all interact with the system in some way.

Response: 

Based on the software requirements, I've extracted the goals/reasons (the 'why') for each couple of actors/actions:

**Users:**

1. **Create and assign tasks by user or user role**: To manage workload efficiently, prioritize tasks, and delegate responsibilities.
2. **View task lists by user or user role**: To stay on top of their task status, identify dependencies, and make informed decisions about task completion.
3. **Re-assign and route tasks from one user to another**: To delegate tasks effectively, avoid bottlenecks, and ensure timely completion.
4. **Designate a task as completed**: To mark tasks as finished, track progress, and provide a sense of accomplishment.
5. **Remove a task without completing it**: To cancel or abandon tasks that are no longer relevant or necessary, freeing up resources for more important tasks.
6. **Document verbal or telephone communication into the patient record**: To maintain accurate and comprehensive patient records, ensuring continuity of care.
7. **Use messaging between users**: To communicate effectively with colleagues, patients, or other stakeholders within the system.

**Administrators:**

1. **Manage system installation, start-up, and connection**: To ensure seamless setup and integration of the system, minimizing downtime and errors.
2. **Configure product capacities (e.g., number of users, transactions per second, records)**: To optimize system performance, scalability, and reliability.
3. **Provide documentation on system error or performance messages**: To help troubleshoot issues quickly and provide user support.
4. **Document procedures for product installation, start-up, and connection**: To establish consistent practices and ensure proper setup for all users.
5. **Define minimal privileges necessary for each service and protocol**: To set permissions and access controls, ensuring secure and authenticated interactions.

**Prescribers:**

1. **Send electronic medication orders to pharmacies or other intended recipients**: To streamline medication ordering, improving patient care and reducing administrative burdens.
2. **Use the system for communication purposes with pharmacies or other recipients of medication orders**: To initiate and manage conversations about patients' medication regimens and treatment plans.

**Pharmacists:**

1. **Receive electronic medication orders from prescribers through the system**: To access accurate, up-to-date information on patient medication needs and orders.

**Clinical Personnel:**

1. **Access and use the system**: To stay informed about patient medical records, test results, and clinical developments.
2. **Maintain a directory of all clinical personnel who currently use or access the system**: To maintain an updated roster of qualified professionals working within the system.

In summary, the goals/reasons for each couple of actors/actions include:

* User efficiency: manage workload, prioritize tasks, delegate responsibilities       
* Effective communication: document verbal communications, use messaging between users
* Workload management: re-assign and route tasks, remove completed tasks
* Patient care: maintain accurate patient records, track medication orders and communicate with pharmacies
* System administration: set up and configure the system, provide documentation and support

These goals are essential for ensuring seamless interactions within the system, promoting efficient workflows, and ultimately enhancing patient care.

Failed answer (incorrect answer)
QUESTION 2.5: Based on the software requirements, identify the goals/reasons (the 'why' in user stories) for each couple of actors/actions (who/what).

Based on the software requirements, I identified the goals or reasons (the 'why' in user stories) for each couple of actors/actions:

1. **Admin/user, Create task**
        * Goal: To manage workload, prioritize tasks, and allocate responsibilities among team members.
2. **Admin/user, Assign task by user/role**
        * Reason: To ensure the right person is handling a task, based on their expertise or role.
3. **Admin/user, Re-assign and route tasks**
        * Goal: To adjust the workflow when tasks are re-prioritized or an individual becomes unavailable.
4. **User, Designate task as completed**
        * Reason: To track progress, measure performance, and provide accountability for task completion.
5. **User, Remove task without completing**
        * Goal: To allow users to cancel tasks that no longer need to be followed up on.   

**Communications-related actions**

1. **User/User, Document verbal/telephone communication**
        * Reason: To maintain accurate records of patient information and communication history.
2. **Prescriber/Pharmacy, Support messaging**
        * Goal: To streamline medication order management by facilitating electronic communication between prescribers and pharmacies.

**System management-related actions**

1. **Admin, System error or performance messaging documentation**
        * Reason: To ensure timely resolution of issues, improve user experience, and reduce downtime.
2. **Admin, Product capacity and configuration documentation**
        * Goal: To provide a clear understanding of system capabilities, limitations, and best practices for administration and maintenance.

**Installation and setup-related actions**

1. **User/Admin, System installation/start-up/connection documentation**
        * Reason: To ensure successful deployment and configuration, reducing downtime and improving overall system usability.

These identified goals or reasons can guide the development and testing of the software, ensuring it meets the needs of its users.
