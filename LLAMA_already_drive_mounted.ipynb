patient, so that all their key identifier information is stored in one place.\n2. **Store multiple identifiers per patient**: As a healthcare provider, I want to store multiple identifiers (e.g., system ID, medical record number) for each patient, so that I can easily track and identify them.\n3. **Merge duplicate patient records**: As a healthcare administrator, I want to merge duplicate patient records into a single patient record, so that patient information is accurate and up-to-date.\n4. **Capture demographic information**: As a healthcare provider, I want to capture and maintain demographic information (e.g., prior names, addresses) for each patient, so that I can better understand their needs and provide personalized care.\n5. **Modify and access historical data**: As a healthcare provider, I want to modify and access historical demographic information as discrete data elements, so that I can see how patients' needs have changed over time.\n6. **Query patients by multiple identifiers**: As a healthcare provider, I want to query for patients using multiple forms of identification (e.g., name, date of birth, medical record number), so that I can easily locate them in the system.\n7. **Capture principal provider information**: As a healthcare administrator, I want to capture and maintain the identity of all providers involved in a patient's care, including the principal provider, so that we can track their roles and responsibilities.\n8. **Maintain coded list of problems or diagnoses**: As a healthcare provider, I want to maintain a coded list of problems or diagnoses for each patient, capturing details such as onset date, resolution date, chronicity, and associated orders or medications.\n9. **Update, display, and document changes to coded list**: As a healthcare provider, I want to update, display, and document changes to the coded list of problems or diagnoses, so that patients' conditions are accurately reflected in their records.\n10. **Capture free text comments associated with problems or diagnoses**: As a healthcare provider, I want to capture and maintain free text comments associated with problems or diagnoses, so that additional context can be provided about patients' conditions.\n11. **Maintain medication list for each patient**: As a healthcare provider, I want to maintain and display a medication list for each patient, including prescribing details, medication history, and dates (ordering, start, modify, renewal, and end).\n12. **Support uncoded or free text medications**: As a healthcare provider, I want the system to support uncoded or free text medications and document changes, so that we can accurately capture patients' medication regimens.\n13. **Manage patient-specific medication list**: As a healthcare provider, I want to manage a patient-specific medication list, including current medications, with functionality to exclude or print medications and document that a patient takes no medications.\n14. **Capture allergy and adverse reaction information**: As a healthcare provider, I want to capture and maintain an allergy and adverse reaction list for each patient, including user modifications, the type of reaction, and an indication of whether the list was reviewed.\n15. **Document absence of known drug allergies or adverse reactions**: As a healthcare provider, I want the system to document if a patient has no known drug allergies or adverse reactions, so that we can ensure their safety when prescribing medications.\n16. **Store comprehensive patient history**: As a healthcare provider, I want to store and display comprehensive patient history, including medication and allergy information as discrete data elements.\n17. **Capture, update, and display patient history**: As a healthcare provider, I want to capture, update, and display patient history, including structured, coded, and free text data, with the ability to record the presence and absence of conditions and capture history from external sources.\n18. **Record conditions as present or absent**: As a healthcare provider, I want to be able to record conditions as present or absent in patients' records, so that we can accurately track their health status over time.\n19. **Capture history from external sources**: As a healthcare provider, I want the system to allow capture of patient history from external sources (e.g., other EHR systems), so that we can ensure complete and accurate information is available for care decisions.\n20. **Manage clinical documentation**: As a healthcare provider, I want to manage clinical documentation, including saving notes in progress, finalizing, cosigning, addending, and correcting notes, as well as tracking changes made by users.\n21. **Track changes made to clinical documentation**: As a healthcare administrator, I want the system to track and display the identity of users making changes to clinical documentation and the date/time of those changes, so that we can maintain audit trails for accountability and compliance.\n22. **Filter, search, and order notes by provider or diagnosis**: As a healthcare provider, I want to filter, search, and order notes by provider or associated diagnosis, with the ability to enter free text notes and customize templates for structured data input.\n23. **Capture patient vital signs and clinical data elements**: As a healthcare provider, I want to capture and manage patient vital signs and other clinical data elements as discrete data, displaying measurements in both metric and English units.\n24. **Graph and calculate metrics like BMI over time**: As a healthcare provider, I want the system to graph and calculate metrics like BMI over time, so that we can track patients' health status and make informed care decisions.\n\nNote: These user stories are designed to meet specific standards or guidelines in healthcare informatics, such as those from HITSP, IHE,
